# Gas Station Optimization Problem

This project explores the classic **gas station refueling optimization problem**. The road-trip scenario where you must travel from point A to point B with varying gas prices at different stations and a car with limited tank capacity.

The goal? **Minimize the total cost of fuel while reaching your destination.**

---

## Problem Overview

Imagine driving across multiple cities.  
Each city has a gas station with different prices, and your tank size is limited.  
So the key question becomes:

**Where should you refuel to minimize cost?**

This project compares two approaches to solve this problem.

## Approaches Compared

### 1. Naive (Brute Force) Approach  
- Tries many possible refueling combinations  
- Very slow for larger inputs  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(Δn³)`  
- Good for understanding, bad for scaling.

### 2. Optimized Algorithm  
Based on the research paper **"To Fill or Not to Fill"**, using two strategic ideas:

1. **Fill up completely** if the next station is more expensive  
2. **Buy just enough fuel** if a cheaper station is ahead  

- Much faster  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(Δn² log n)`  
- Efficient even with many stations.
